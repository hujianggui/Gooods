## Algorithms for recommendation systems in C#

### The algorithms
	[0] Global mean, user mean, item mean filling methods. Those are used for rating prediction.
	[1] UserKNN (user-based collaborative filtering), rating prediction.
	    UserKNNv2 (user-based collaborative filtering, multithread for W), top-N recommendation.
	[2] ItemKNNv2 (item-based collaborative filtering, multithread for W), top-N recommendation.
	[3] Matrix Factorization, rating prediction, top-N recommendation.
	[4] Biased Matrix Factorization, rating prediction, top-N recommendation.
	[5] SVD++ (speed up), rating prediction.
	[6] Alternating Least Lquares, rating prediction, top-N recommendation.
	[7] Euclidean Embedding, rating prediction, top-N recommendation.
	[8]	SLIM (sparse linear model) (train with multithread), top-N recommendation.
	[9] FISM (Factored Item Similarity Models), top-N recommendation.
	[10] SocialMF, rating prediction, top-N recommendation.
	[11] Friend Matrix Factorization, rating prediction, top-N recommendation.
	    Friend Biased Matrix Factorization, rating prediction, top-N recommendation.
